<p> This is Sameer Thakre, a Dreamer and a Seeker. Currently I am in final year of IT engineering. I 
  am interested in learning how website works, creating some webpages. In near future I will become
  full stack developer(soft. eng). I also have interest in blockchain technology so I will always look 
  fowward to see if i can get exposure to work in these field.

<p>I likes to listen audiobooks, and watch movies. One of my favorite audiobook is When Breathe 
  become air, and Candide by Voltaire. In movies my favorite is The Shawshank Redemption.
